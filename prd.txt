📘 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Name: MindVault Telegram Bot
1. Overview

MindVault is a Telegram-based personal knowledge vault bot that allows users to save links, articles, videos, and text directly from Telegram chats. The bot automatically extracts metadata, generates filenames, assigns tags using rule-based logic (no AI, no external APIs), and stores the content in a structured format.

The bot is designed to run fully serverless using Telegram webhooks on Vercel or Netlify, with zero mandatory cost. All data remains user-owned and exportable as Markdown.

2. Core Features
2.1 Content Saving

The bot accepts:

URLs (articles, blogs, YouTube links)

Plain text notes

Forwarded Telegram messages

For each input, the bot:

Extracts title and description

Detects content type (article, video, note)

Generates a filename

Applies automatic tags

Stores a Telegram message deep link for reference

2.2 Auto Filename & Tagging

Filename format:

<primary-keyword>-<secondary-keyword>-YYYY-MM-DD.md


Tagging logic (rule-based):

Domain-based (youtube → #video, medium → #article)

Keyword-based (docker → #docker, aws → #cloud)

Length-based (#long-read)

No AI or paid APIs are used.

3. Telegram Response

After saving, the bot replies in the same chat with formatted Telegram Markdown:

📌 Saved Successfully
📄 Title: …
🗂 Filename: …
🏷 Tags: …
🔗 Source: …


Markdown formatting is preserved using telegram-markdownify.

4. Data Storage

Each saved item includes:

User ID

Chat ID & message ID

Telegram deep link

Filename

Tags

Content

Timestamp

Storage is serverless-compatible (JSON / KV / optional database).

5. Export & Backup System
5.1 Markdown Export

Users can export all saved data as clean Markdown files, organized tag-wise into folders, with an auto-generated INDEX.md.

5.2 Daily Automatic Backup

Runs once every 24 hours

Triggered via Vercel Cron

Generates a ZIP backup

Filename includes date and time

Example:

mindvault-backup-2026-02-06_23-59-IST.zip

6. Backup Delivery Options (User Choice)
